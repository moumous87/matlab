Installing the NaN-tb for Octave and Matlab:
--------------------------------------------
a) Extract files and save them in /your/directory/structure/to/NaN/

b) Include the path with one of the following commands: 
	addpath('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/')
	path('/your/directory/structure/to/NaN/',path)
   Make sure the functions in the NaN-toolbox are found before the default functions.  
   	
c) run NANINSTTEST 
This checks whether the installation was successful. 

d) [OPTIONAL]: 
  To improve speed, you can use the MEX-version of SUMSKIPNAN. 
  Some precompiled binaries are provided. If your platform is not supported, 
  compile the C-Mex-function SUMSKIPNAN_MEX.CPP using
    mex sumskipnan_mex.cpp
  The oct-file sumskipnan_oct.cc is broken, but Octave can also use 
  the mex-file.  
    mkoctfile --mex sumskipnan_mex.cpp

  Run NANINSTTEST again to check the stability of the compiled SUMSKIPNAN.  

e) HINT: if SUMSKIPNAN_MEX causes problems, you can savely remove it. 
Then the (slower) M-file is used.
